# NBA-Player-Evaluator
Version 1 of my NBA Player Evaluator


In this version, the scoring model works by comparing the chosen player's stats to the league average (given by StatMuse or Basketball-Reference)
Each position also values certain stats more than others.
  A point guard values assists more than rebounds
  A center values rebounds more than assists
This is why i've made the player position a user choice, as to better compare players of that specific position rather than across all positions!
